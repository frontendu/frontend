## JSConf EU

[JSConf EU](https://2018.jsconf.eu/) started announcing their speakers. The first announced speaker [became](https://twitter.com/jsconfeu/status/965954128244629509) [Ashi Krishnan](https://github.com/queerviolet) with the talk «Deep Learning in JS» that introducing to us deeplearn.js and telling us how to use technology advances in AI with JavaScript.

One of the following speakers [was announced](https://twitter.com/jsconfeu/status/965954131272896512) [Shelley Vohr](https://twitter.com/codebytere): «Asynchrony: Under The Hood» as a journey exploring all aspects of asynchronous programming in Javascript.

Certainly, no less steep talks and speakers have been presented over the past time. Check [the entire list](https://2018.jsconf.eu/speakers/), we know you will find an excuse to get to the conference.

## Going Offline

[Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan) finished reading [Jeremy Keith](https://twitter.com/adactio)'s book «[Going online](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline)» and very very very recommends it. Ok, [now we are sure](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/984756849835741185), let's read if you aren't already tired about PWA and Service Workers.

## Kent C. Dodds's Essential JavaScript

[Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) [asked](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/987755565781692416) his followers what to add *fundamental* about JavaScript in his new course «Essential JavaScript». Cool! Especialy for a good chat in a boring day because, you could guess, the range of opinions is huge. Add all of them, Kent, just add all of them, and you will invent [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do).

## Fundamentals VS Frameworks

Oh... It's a great chatter. [Ben Lesh](https://twitter.com/BenLesh) throw in to community something sweet. [Let's give him a word](https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/987863005848195073):

> If you're a complete beginner starting off in JavaScript, there is nothing wrong with just learning a framework up front. Don't listen to people that say you have to master fundamentals first. You have to master them *eventually* but you need to have fun and be productive first.

And he continues:

> I'm frequently asked by beginners, "Where do I start?" Start with fun, start with curiosity. Cramming knowledge is all well and good, but you'll burn yourself out doing that. The path to success isn't *all* blood and sweat. If it's not fun, you'll either give up or suck at it.

It's very controversial opinion. That's all what we can to say. See [replies](https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/987863005848195073).

Ok... no. We will fight for fundamentals. Frameworks are not with us forever.
